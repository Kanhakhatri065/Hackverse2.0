# Hackverse2.0

## Distributed Compiler

### Description
" Have a low powered laptop?, Want to compile a huge project?, Stuck at home?, don't worry we got you covered ! ". 
Distributed compiler aims to achieve compilation of programs and projects on the distributed network. 
User needs to push his code and request compilation, so the system will look for listeners whose compilers
are sitting idle and we can compile the projects on the system of other users/listeners and assign the job to them.
User will get his compiled files.

Our project comes under the track "Let's go contactless".
